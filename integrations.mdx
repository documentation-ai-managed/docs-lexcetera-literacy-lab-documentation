## Best Practices for Extensions

Maximize value from integrations with these guidelines.

- Limit triggers to high-impact events like completions or dropouts.
- Use batch processing for large learner groups to avoid rate limits (`<100` requests/minute).
- Monitor logs in the dashboard for connection health.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Webhook Example" default-open="false">
    Set up a custom endpoint to receive events.

    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhook/lexcetera', (req, res) => {
      const { event, data } = req.body;
      if (event === 'lesson.completed') {
        // Sync to your LMS
        updateLMSProgress(data.user_id, data.lesson_id);
      }
      res.status(200).json({ received: true });
    });
    ```
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
    - **401 Unauthorized**: Check API key permissions.
    - **Timeout errors**: Reduce payload size `{max: 10kb}`.
    - **Duplicate events**: Enable idempotency with `request_id`.
